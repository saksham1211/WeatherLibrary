# WeatherLibrary
Want to add a card which shows current temprature in your application? Instead of using complex weather APIs for such an simple task, I have created an Android Library which will help you to include current weather condition of current location with minimal lines of code.

## Update:- 

Easy to use Weather Library coming soon.
